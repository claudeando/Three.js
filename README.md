# THREE.JS

This repo is for learning purposes.


Minor things I often forget.
1. renderer attributes such as setPixelRatio, shadowMap.enabled.
2. controls take two args (1. camera, the stuff the controls manipulate 2. renderer.domElement, update it to the domElement.)
3. controls.enableDumping, update method to be applied both after the declaration and in animation loop.


To be continued.
